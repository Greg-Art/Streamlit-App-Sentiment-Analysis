# Embedding a Pre-Trained Model Into A GUI

## Project Description 🧐


The objective of this challenge is to fine-tune a pre-trained model to assess if a Twitter post is about COVID-19 or not. This model will help gather tweet data about the epidemic without relying only on keywords like ‘covid’ or ‘coronavirus’ being present, allowing researchers and engineers to pick a more comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis.

This model could be put into practice as part of a larger effort to understand online sentiment around COVID-19, and inform future communications and public interventions by governments and non-government public health organisations.
