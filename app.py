The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a twitter post that is related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative.

Variable definition:

tweet_id: Unique identifier of the tweet

safe_tweet: Text contained in the tweet. Some sensitive information has been removed like usernames and urls

label: Sentiment of the tweet (-1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive)

agreement: The tweets were labeled by three people. Agreement indicates the percentage of the three reviewers that agreed on the given label. You may use this column in your training, but agreement data will not be shared for the test set.
